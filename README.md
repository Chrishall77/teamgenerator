# Slim2Win Friendly Fixture Team Generator
This is a mobile first basic team generator that splits a pool of players into two teams.
It is designed to be used when Slim2Win's football season is over and players are invited to come and play friendly fixtures in mixed teams.
The app can be applied to any sport.
## Basic setup
To set up the app, simply transfer the contents of the site folder to your web hosting provider's public or equivalent directory.

The web page file is called index.html. This can be renamed.

The scripts folder contains the file randomsplit.js. This can NOT be renamed or moved.

## Technical Requirements
You will need a web browser. The site was developed using the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox. The site has also been been tested on Edge, Opera and Safari and will work fine on any of those.

Javascript is required.
